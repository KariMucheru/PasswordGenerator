# Password-Generator-in-python

The code block does the following:

Import the in-built random the module used to generate random numbers
Create an empty list [] with the variable, password_list
Iterate through the number in the range function to create a sequence of numbers from the start index and end with the last index plus 1
Next, append the empty list to get a randomly selected element using the random.choice() method for each of the characterâ€™s declared variables
Shuffle the newly created password_list changing the position of the elements every time a new password using the .shuffle() method
